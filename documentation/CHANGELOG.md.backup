  - Automatically reads twilight type from `config.json`
  - Supports both high-precision and standard calculation modes
  - Proper timezone handling and error fallbacks
- **🔄 Backward compatibility maintained**:
  - Legacy `find_astronomical_twilight()` function preserved
  - All existing code continues to work unchanged
  - Seamless integration with existing applications
