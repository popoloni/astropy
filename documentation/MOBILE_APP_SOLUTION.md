## Technical Implementation

### Mobile Plotting System

```python
# MobilePlotGenerator creates touch-optimized plots
mobile_plot_generator.create_trajectory_plot(target_name, trajectory_data)
mobile_plot_generator.create_visibility_chart(location, date_range)
mobile_plot_generator.create_altitude_plot(target_name, altitude_data)
mobile_plot_generator.create_mosaic_plot(title, mosaic_groups)
```

### Custom Kivy Widgets

```python
# PlotWidget for displaying matplotlib plots in Kivy
plot_widget = PlotWidget()
plot_widget.display_plot(figure)

# PlotContainer for tabbed plot views
plot_container = PlotContainer()
plot_container.add_plot_tab("Trajectory", trajectory_figure)
plot_container.add_plot_tab("Altitude", altitude_figure)
```

### Report Generation

```python
# MobileReportGenerator creates comprehensive reports
report_generator = MobileReportGenerator()
session_report = report_generator.generate_session_report(targets, location)
target_report = report_generator.generate_target_report(target_data)
mosaic_report = report_generator.generate_mosaic_report(mosaic_groups)
```
