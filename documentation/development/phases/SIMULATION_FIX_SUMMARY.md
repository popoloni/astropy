# Time Simulation Fix Summary ✅

## Issue Identified
The time simulation functionality was failing with:
```
NameError: name 'get_simulated_datetime' is not defined
```

When trying to run simulation tests like:
```bash
python wrappers/run_test_simulation.py
python astropy.py --simulate-time 01:30 --report-only
```

## Root Cause
Two missing imports in `astropy.py`:
1. `get_simulated_datetime` function was not imported from `utilities.time_sim`
2. The `time_sim` module itself was not imported (needed for `time_sim.SIMULATED_DATETIME`)

## Fix Applied
Added the missing imports to `astropy.py`:

### Before (Broken):
```python
from utilities.time_sim import get_current_datetime
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
from utilities.time_sim import get_current_datetime, get_simulated_datetime
from utilities import time_sim
```

## What This Enables
The time simulation functionality allows testing the astronomical observation planning system during daytime by simulating nighttime conditions:

- **`--simulate-time HH:MM`**: Simulate running at a specific time (e.g., 01:30 for 1:30 AM)
- **Test Wrapper**: `wrappers/run_test_simulation.py` for automated simulation testing
- **Perfect for Development**: Test night observation planning during the day

## Test Results After Fix
✅ **Time Simulation Working**: Both direct command and wrapper script functional
✅ **All Test Cases Passing**: 10/10 tests passing (100% success rate)  
✅ **Normal Operation Preserved**: Regular functionality unaffected
✅ **Complete Integration**: Works with all scheduling strategies and features

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test simulation wrapper
python wrappers/run_test_simulation.py

# Test direct simulation
python astropy.py --simulate-time 01:30 --report-only --date 2024-06-01

# Verify normal operation still works
python astropy.py --report-only --date 2024-01-01

# Run complete test suite
cd tests && python run_tests.py
```

## Benefits
1. **Development Efficiency**: Test night functionality during daytime
2. **Consistent Testing**: Reproducible conditions for testing
3. **Demo Capabilities**: Show off features at any time of day
4. **Debugging Support**: Simulate specific conditions for troubleshooting

## Status
**Time Simulation is now FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ✅

The astronomical observation planning system now supports both real-time and simulated time operations, making development and testing much more efficient.
