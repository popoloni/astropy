- **Priority Based**: Respects your target priorities
- **Time Efficient**: Minimizes equipment changes and slewing
- **Balanced**: Good all-around choice for most sessions

#### Target Selection
Select targets using one of three methods:
1. **From Planned**: Use targets from your planned objects list
2. **From Filtered**: Use currently filtered targets from the targets screen
3. **Custom Selection**: Manually select specific targets from a checklist

### 3. Session Optimization

The system automatically:
- Calculates optimal observation times for each target
- Considers altitude, visibility windows, and moon interference
- Estimates observation duration based on target type and session goals
- Arranges targets in optimal sequence to minimize setup time
- Provides backup targets for changing conditions

### 4. Managing Sessions
