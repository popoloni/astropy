# AstroPy for Pythonista (iPad)

This directory contains wrapper scripts designed specifically for running AstroPy Observation Planner in the Pythonista app on iPad. Since command-line arguments are difficult to use in Pythonista, these scripts provide simple one-tap access to the most common observation planning modes.

## ‚≠ê NEW FEATURE: Yellow Labels for Scheduled Objects

The trajectory plots now show **yellow transparent backgrounds** on labels for objects that are scheduled for observation! This makes it easy to spot which objects in the trajectory plots are recommended for tonight's session.

- **üü° Yellow labels**: Objects scheduled for observation (same ones with red hatching in visibility chart)
- **‚ö™ White labels**: Objects visible but not scheduled

## üÜï NEW FEATURE: Mosaic Group Trajectory Plots

**Specialized plotting for Vaonis Vespera Passenger mosaic photography!** The new mosaic trajectory plotter identifies objects that can be photographed together in the same 4.7¬∞ √ó 3.5¬∞ mosaic field of view and creates three dedicated chart types:

- **Combined mosaic group plot**: All groups color-coded on one chart with legend
- **Detail grid plot**: Individual group plots arranged in a grid without legends to maximize space  
- **Mosaic visibility chart**: Timeline showing when each group is observable with duration information
- **Field of view indicators**: Visual ellipses showing optimal mosaic positioning
- **Observation windows**: Exact timing for when groups are simultaneously visible

## Quick Start Scripts

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy all files** from this directory to your Pythonista app
2. **Ensure you have** `astropy.py` and `config.json` in the same directory
3. **Tap any script** to run it directly in Pythonista

## ‚úÖ iOS Compatibility

All wrapper scripts have been updated for full iOS/Pythonista compatibility:
- **No subprocess calls** - Scripts now directly import and call functions
- **Native iOS support** - Works perfectly in Pythonista 3
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error reporting for debugging
- **Path management** - Automatic import path setup for all dependencies

The scripts are now fully optimized for iOS and will work without any compatibility issues.

## Configuration for iPad

Make sure your `config.json` is configured for your location:

```json
{
  "locations": {
    "your_location": {
      "name": "Your Location",
      "latitude": 45.516667,
      "longitude": 9.216667,
      "timezone": "Europe/Rome",
      "min_altitude": 15,
      "max_altitude": 75,
      "bortle_index": 6,
      "default": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommended Workflow for iPad

### For Quick Checks:
1. Run `run_report_only.py` for instant text results
2. Use `run_test_simulation.py` during daytime to test

### For Visual Planning:
1. Start with `run_quarters.py` for clean 4-quarter visualization with yellow scheduled labels
2. Use `run_with_plots.py` for complete single-plot overview with yellow scheduled labels

### For Mosaic Photography (Vespera Passenger): üÜï
1. First run `analyze_mosaic_groups.py` to see available mosaic groups
2. Then use `run_mosaic_plots.py` for specialized trajectory plots with FOV indicators
3. Use individual group plots for detailed planning of each mosaic session

### For Specific Goals:
- **Astrophotography**: Use `run_optimal_snr.py` or `run_longest_duration.py`
- **Mosaic astrophotography**: Use `run_mosaic_plots.py` üÜï
- **Visual observation**: Use `run_max_objects.py`
- **Survey work**: Use `run_max_objects.py`

### Testing the New Features:
- Use `test_yellow_labels.py` to see the yellow label feature in action
- Use `run_mosaic_plots.py` to see mosaic group plotting üÜï

## Understanding the Visual Cues

### In Standard Trajectory Plots:
- **üü° Yellow label backgrounds**: Objects scheduled for observation tonight
- **‚ö™ White label backgrounds**: Objects visible but not in tonight's schedule
- **Solid lines**: Objects with sufficient observation time
- **Dashed lines**: Objects with insufficient observation time

### In Mosaic Trajectory Plots: üÜï
- **Color-coded trajectories**: Each mosaic group has a unique color
- **Different line styles**: Objects within the same group use varied line styles (solid, dashed, etc.)
- **Field of view ellipses**: Semi-transparent ellipses showing optimal mosaic positioning
- **Group information boxes**: Timing windows and object separations for each group
- **Three chart types**:
  - **Combined chart**: All groups with legend for overview
  - **Detail grid**: Individual plots without legends for detailed planning
  - **Visibility chart**: Timeline bars showing observation windows

### In Visibility Charts:
- **Red hatching**: Scheduled observation periods 
- **Green bars**: Recommended objects
- **Gray bars**: Other visible objects
- **Gold/Yellow segments**: Moon interference periods

The yellow labels in trajectory plots correspond exactly to the objects with red hatching in the visibility chart!

## Vespera Passenger Configuration üÜï

Your `config.json` now includes Vespera Passenger specifications:

```json
{
  "imaging": {
    "scope": {
      "name": "Vaonis Vespera Passenger",
      "fov_width": 2.4,
      "fov_height": 1.8,
      "mosaic_fov_width": 4.7,
      "mosaic_fov_height": 3.5,
      "native_resolution_mp": 6.2,
      "mosaic_resolution_mp": 24,
      "sensor": "Sony IMX585"
    }
  }
}
```

This enables:
- Accurate field of view calculations for both native and mosaic modes
- Proper mosaic group analysis based on your telescope's capabilities
- Realistic trajectory plotting with correct FOV indicators

## Troubleshooting

If you get import errors:
1. Make sure `astropy.py` is in the same folder
2. Check that all required libraries are installed in Pythonista:
   - numpy
   - matplotlib  
   - pytz

If plots don't display properly:
1. Try the text-only versions first (`run_report_only.py`)
2. Make sure matplotlib is working in your Pythonista installation

## Files Needed

Make sure you have these files in your Pythonista directory:
- `astropy.py` (main program)
- `config.json` (your configuration with Vespera Passenger specs) üÜï
- All the `run_*.py` scripts (these wrapper scripts)
- `test_yellow_labels.py` ‚≠ê **NEW** (test script for yellow labels)
- `analyze_mosaic_groups.py` üÜï **NEW** (mosaic group analysis)
- `plot_mosaic_trajectories.py` üÜï **NEW** (mosaic trajectory plotting)
- `run_mosaic_plots.py` üÜï **NEW** (mosaic plotting wrapper)
- Any catalog files you're using (e.g., `catalog_fixed.csv`)

## Performance Tips

- Text-only scripts (`run_report_only.py`, `run_quarters_report.py`) run fastest
- Plot-generating scripts may take longer on iPad
- The 4-quarter plots (`run_quarters.py`) are often cleaner than single plots
- Mosaic plots (`run_mosaic_plots.py`) generate 3 charts and may take a few seconds to analyze groups üÜï
- Use simulation mode (`run_test_simulation.py`) for testing without waiting for nighttime
- Try `test_yellow_labels.py` to see the new yellow label feature in action

Enjoy your astronomical observations with better visual scheduling cues and comprehensive mosaic photography planning! üåü
