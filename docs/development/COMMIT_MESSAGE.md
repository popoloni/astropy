Add comprehensive mosaic photography planning for Vespera Passenger

## New Features

### Mosaic Group Analysis System
- Add `analyze_mosaic_groups.py` with angular separation calculations
- Implement simultaneous visibility analysis for multi-object mosaic sessions
- Add field of view fitting algorithms for 4.7° × 3.5° mosaic FOV
- Calculate optimal observation windows for object groups

### Three-Chart Visualization System
- Add `plot_mosaic_trajectories.py` with three specialized chart types:
  1. Combined trajectory plot with color-coded groups and legend
  2. Detail grid layout without legends for space optimization  
  3. Mosaic visibility timeline with duration information
- Implement field of view ellipses showing optimal telescope positioning
- Add automatic grid layout with max 3 columns for tablet viewing

### iPad Integration
- Add `run_mosaic_plots.py` Pythonista wrapper script
- Update `README_PYTHONISTA.md` with comprehensive mosaic documentation
- Integrate with existing yellow label system for scheduled objects
- Maintain consistency with all existing wrapper script patterns

### Configuration Updates
- Update `config.json` with Vespera Passenger specifications:
  - Native FOV: 2.4° × 1.8°
  - Mosaic FOV: 4.7° × 3.5°
  - Sony IMX585 sensor specifications
  - 6.2MP native, 24MP mosaic resolution

### Documentation
- Add `MOSAIC_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md` with complete feature overview
- Update main `README.md` with mosaic features in features list and recent updates
- Document technical implementation details and usage workflows
- Add performance considerations and future enhancement possibilities

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithms
- Spherical trigonometry for precise angular separation calculations
- Bounding box analysis with declination correction for FOV fitting
- Time window overlap algorithms for simultaneous visibility
- Smart collision detection for optimal label positioning

### Visual Features
- Consistent color coding across all three chart types
- Field of view ellipses at optimal observation times
- Hour markers with reduced frequency for small plots
- Duration and separation information display
- Automatic subplot arrangement and legend management

### Performance Optimizations
- Memory efficient trajectory calculation
- Selective plotting for better performance
- Automatic grid dimension calculation
- Z-order management for proper layering
